                        <p class="summary-p">

                            The College of Fine Arts is one of the oldest, largest and most prestigious colleges of the University of Tehran. When it opened over seventy years ago, it laid the foundations for academic study in various forms of art in Iran. Today, the College of
                            Fine Arts of the University of Tehran is a unique center for the study of art in all its different disciplines, and its influence is particularly strong in Iran and the Middle East. The college started its activities in November
                            1939 under the name of "Honarkadeh" [Art School]. The primary focus was on the three fields of Architecture, Painting and Sculpture. Now, over seven decades after its establishment, it has a special status in the eyes of Iranians,
                            particularly in the areas of Visual Arts, Architecture and Urban Planning. It was in 2005 that the Faculty of Fine Arts was expanded and renamed to the College of Fine Arts consisting of the five schools of Architecture, Urban
                            Planning, Industrial Design, Visual Arts, Performing Arts and Music, and a research institute entitled Culture and Arts. At present, the College of Fine Arts has over 110 faculty members. Numerous graduates and faculty members
                            of the college are presently distinguished and well-known figures in the country, and in some cases, internationally. These individuals have won various prestigious awards in art festivals around the world.

            <img class="img-monitor" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/S6NmOF3Dt8ky4hk6xr/giphy.gif">
            <p class="intro2">Web developers uses web languages and software tools to develop the design and functionality of a website. Notice, that web developers are further split into two sub-categories; front-end developers, and back-end developers. I see front-end
                developers as the connection between both web designers and back-end developers, as having a little knowledge of both, would allow a front-end developer to build a fully working website. A front-end developer is the one who builds the
                interface, and provides the layout as the interaction between the back-end of the website and the user.
